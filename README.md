# Willow's AI Portfolio

Hey there! I'm Willow — a junior AI student with a passion for building intelligent systems that adapt, analyze, and assist. This portfolio showcases a range of projects exploring different corners of artificial intelligence and data science, from computer vision and natural language generation to structured data analysis.

Each folder contains a self-contained project, with:
- A short summary
- The core code
- Sample outputs
- Tech used
- What I learned

I'm always looking to improve — so feel free to reach out or check back as I add more!
